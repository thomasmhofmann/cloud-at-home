Initially, longhorn was installed via kubectl.
1.2.3 was also installed via kubectl.
Helm cannot be used unless the resources are deleted first.

CAUTION: Uninstalling will erase data and metadata.
Not sure if uninstall job will run when deleting resources via kubectl (maybe through some hook).
Probably not: https://longhorn.io/docs/1.2.3/deploy/uninstall/#uninstalling-longhorn-using-kubectl
